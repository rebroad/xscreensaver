## Change Log

### 2023-11-23: Modernized hextrail.c Rendering

#### Summary
Implemented vertex-based rendering with shader support in hextrail.c while maintaining backward compatibility with older hardware.

#### Details
1. **Shader Support with Fallback**
   - Added modern OpenGL shader program support with vertex and fragment shaders
   - Implemented runtime detection of OpenGL capabilities
   - Created fallback path for older hardware that doesn't support shaders

2. **Vertex-Based Rendering**
   - Converted immediate mode rendering to use vertex buffer objects (VBOs)
   - Added vertex attribute arrays for position and color data
   - Implemented dynamic vertex buffer resizing for better performance

3. **Enhanced Visual Effects**
   - Added glow effect implemented in fragment shader
   - Improved visual quality when running on modern hardware
   - Maintained original visual appearance on legacy systems

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - All changes maintain compatibility with older systems
   - Code conditionally uses immediate mode rendering when shaders aren't available
   - Preserved all existing functionality while adding new capabilities
